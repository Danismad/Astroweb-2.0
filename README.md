# Astroweb-2.0
A website to learn about astronomy and the cosmos, this is also my first website 

## Description ##
✨Astroweb is a project developed as part of the summer camp organized by Technolochicas Foundation in collaboration with Microsoft and Fundación Televisa. This project's main objective was to create a website about something I like, and I LOVE astronomy, so I made this using HTML and CSS, with some bootstrap elements.✨
